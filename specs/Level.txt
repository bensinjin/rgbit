  _calculateScore(currentBoardState, solutionBoardState)
    Compare currentBoardState with the result from _calculateSolution to calculate a score for this level.

    This will create a solution array from the solution board state.

  onLevelOver(reason, currentBoardState, solutionBoardState):
    Child components should call this either when time is up or a solution is met.
